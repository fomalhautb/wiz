## Features

- **Command Generation**: Wiz interprets natural language descriptions to generate the corresponding terminal commands.
- **Command Explanation**: Alongside command generation, Wiz also provides a detailed explanation of what each command does.
- **Open Source**: Wiz is completely open-source, allowing for community enhancements and adaptations.
- **Runs Locally**: Your data never leaves your machine. Wiz runs completely locally, ensuring the privacy and security of your data.

## Installation

Wiz can be easily installed via npm:

```bash
npm install -g wiz-cli
```

You can update to the latest version at any time using the same command.

**Note:** Wiz requires Node.js to run. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

## Usage

wiz 'create a new directory named "test"'
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Cross-Platform Compatibility: Expand support for Windows and Linux, as Wiz currently only runs on macOS.
- [ ] Improved Suggestions: Enhance the suggestion model to provide more accurate and diverse command possibilities.
- [ ] Inactivity Server Shutdown: Implement a feature to stop the inference server after a period of inactivity to conserve system resources.
- [ ] Support for Command History: Implement a feature where Wiz can recall and explain previous commands.
- [ ] Machine-learning powered command correction: Implement a feature where Wiz can correct commands executed by the user.
- [ ] Command Completion: Implement a feature where Wiz can complete partial commands entered by the user.
